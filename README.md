# imbalanced_binary_classification_psat_winter

## Winter seminar for the Sungkyunkwan University Statistics Department Study P-SAT (February 1st ~ 8th, 2021)
* This repository contains all files that follow the workflow of data preprocessing - modeling - prediction, specifically designed in order to solve a binary classification issue
in an imbalanced dataset.
* For reproduction, first download the related files given, 'train.csv' and 'test_features.csv'.
* After downloading essential dataset files, follow path of **'1.preprocess.ipynb' - '2.modeling.ipynb' - '3.prediction.ipynb'**.
* List objects and pickle objects will follow naturally when running the files in the right order.
* This project is a variation of the [Kaggle Challenge - Air pressure system failures in Scania trucks](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/aps-failure-at-scania-trucks-data-set)
